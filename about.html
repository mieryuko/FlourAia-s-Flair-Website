            Ever since I was a kid, I loved daydreaming about what I wanted in life. I was always clear 
            with myself—I wanted to have a coffee shop where I could sell pastries and fresh flowers every 
            day, even though I had no idea where to find those pastries and cakes. Fast forward to today, 
            FlourAia’s Flair started as a simple “past-time” during the pandemic, when everyone was stuck 
            at home. It eventually grew into an expensive hobby that required lots of equipment and costly 
            ingredients.Ever since I was a kid, I loved daydreaming about what I wanted in life. I was always

            Fast forward to 
            today, FlourAia’s Flair started as a simple “past-time” during the pandemic, when everyone was 
            stuck at home. It eventually grew into an expensive hobby that required lots of equipment and 
            costly ingredients.
            I used to share my cakes and pastries with loved ones, and their positive feedback motivated me 
            to keep going. As I nourished them with baked goods, their kind words fueled my confidence to 
            turn my passion into a business. At first, I was scared and hesitant—it took years of courage to 
            admit that I wanted more people to try my creations.

            Then, one school event challenged me to step 
            out of my comfort zone, and that’s when FlourAia’s Flair was born. We started by selling simple 
            brownies topped with almonds and walnuts. Thanks to the love and support from customers, and the 
            savings I earned, I was able to expand our menu to include cookies and cakes.
            FlourAia’s Flair is just a one-year-old business aiming to serve more customers and bake more 
            delicious treats. We love the idea of seeing our cakes on the tables of celebrants, knowing they 
            trust us with their special days. While we are still a small business, our vision to celebrate and 
            spread sweetness remains big.
